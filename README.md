# Forum Application Development
Welcome to this full-stack web application built with React, Node.js, and Express, with Axios for API requests. This project showcases skills in building scalable and efficient web applications using industry-standard tools and frameworks. The application provides the ability for users to to engage with each other in a connected forum. To get started, simply clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the server. Enjoy!

## Project Description
This project is called WebForum. The idea of this project is to create a forum application similar to Reddit or Hacker News. Where users can create, delete, edit, like both posts and comments.

Any additional time would be spent primarily on:

- **Testing:** Identifying and resolving issues to ensure the robustness of the application.
  
- **Refactoring Code to Avoid Duplication:** Enhancing code quality by eliminating redundancy and improving maintainability.

- **More Extensive Error Handling:** Strengthening error handling mechanisms for a more resilient and user-friendly application.


## How to run

#### Introduction:
These instructions will guide you through running the full stack application using React, TypeScript and CSS for the frontend, and TypeScript, Node.js, and Express for the backend. The server and client sides are separated into two different folders. By the end of these instructions, you will have successfully started both the server and client side of the application with one command, and be able to interact with the website on your local machine.

#### Instructions:

* Install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

* Clone or download the repository https://github.com/Zakariya00/Forum-Application.git

* Navigate to the root folder of the project (parent folder of both server & client) in the terminal or command prompt.

* Run the command "npm install" to install all the required dependencies for both the client and server sides of the application.

* Wait for the server to start running.

* Head to http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.
